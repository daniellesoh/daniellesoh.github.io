				<h3> Version Control </h3>
					<p>After making the website, we were tasked to document how to retract/extract lost data using git.</p>
					
				<h3>Process</h3>
				<table>

    					<td><img src="../images/prototypesketch.jpg" alt="prototype sketch" width="300px" height="auto">
    					</td>
    					<td>
							<li>I sketched out the dimensions in 3D roughly on paper and outlined it with a black marker for better visibility. My intention was to make a whole piece with folds so that it could become a box.</li>
							<li>I drew out all the parts onto the cardboard in one long continuous strip as shown in the picture below: </li>
							<li>I use stripes to indicate which areas I need to cut out and remove.</li>
							<li>After cutting them out using a penknife, scissors and a ruler, I scored lines where I needed the cardboard to fold as well as for the flaps.</li>
							<li>Fold into a box and make a valley on the parts where your phone should rest on.</li>

				<h3> Hero Shots </h3>
				<img src="../images/heroshot.jpg" alt="heroshot 1" width="300px" height="auto">
				<h3>Pros</h3>
				<p>
					<li>It can withstand the weight of the phone while it rests on its length</li>
					<li>small, can fit into bag</li>
					<li>can stored small trinkets inside, even tissue if possible</li>
				</p>

				<h3> Cons</h3>
				<p>
					<img src="../images/cons.jpg" alt="gaps in the prototype" width = "300px" height ="auto">
					<li> Not as tight fitting as I would liked (some gaps) </li>
					<li>Did not manage to achieve my goal of it being foldable as I realized in order for the flaps to fit securely, the base needs to be glued together. </li>
					<li>Canâ€™t hold the weight of the phone when its placed vertically</li>
