				<h2>Smart Calcifer Trash Bin</h2>
				<p>
					For my final project, I plan to make an automatic trash bin which flips open when a person is near the trash bin using a ultrasonic sensor, with a design of Calcifer for the lid; one of the characters in an animation movie called "Howl's Moving Castle". I would like to have the bin light up after the trash has been thrown and the lid closed.

				<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>Here are the references I have used for this project; the first one being the main one while the other is less referenced:

					</ul>

				<p>
					For the lights, I plan on using two neopixel strips that would light up after the lid of the trash bin has closed. These will be placed on the inside of the trash bin.

				<h3>Rough Sketch</h3>

				<p> 
				Here is what the final prototype will look like, note that the measurements and specifications might change along the way.
				</p>


				<p> 
					Here are a list of the components and materials I will be using:
					<li>
						Input Device: 1 Ultrasensor 
					</li>
						
					<li>
						Output Device: 2 strips of 8 Neopixels
					</li>

					<li>
						Lasercutting: 
						Base, body, cover lid (see fusion 360 sketch for more details)
						Materials: Wood and Thick Corrugated Cardboard
					</li> 

					<li> 
						3D Print: Hinge Parts
					</li>

					<li>
						Arduino Uno 
					</li>

					<li>
						Jumper Wires 
					</li>

					<li>
						1 Breadboard
					</li>

					<li>
						Resistors 
					</li>
					
				</p>

				<h3>Process: Lasercutting the Base, Cover Lid and Body</h3>
				<p> Using the User Parameters, I set out fixed values for each of the dimensions such as the width, height and length of each component. I also set such values for the finger joints so that it is easier for me to change the value whenever I want. For my prototype, I set the thickeness to 5mm but 3mm is also thick enough. 
				</p> 

				<p>To work more efficiently, sketch out for one side with all the dimensions in place and from there extrude it out. If you are forming a regular cube, you just need to sketch out one side. After extruding the side to the thickness you want- in my case it is 5mm- under "Construct", select the "Midplane" option. You want to select the planes where the midplane will be at. After that use the mirror tool under "Create" and choose the midplane as well as the components you want to copy across.
