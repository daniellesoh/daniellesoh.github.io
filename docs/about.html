    					<td>Greetings!
    					<p>I'm Danielle S. a Year Two currently studying in DXCD (Diploma in Experience in Communication and Design). I live in Yishun, Singapore where the weather is always unpredictable. </p>
						<p>The reason why I chose DFAB (Digital Fabrication and Prototyping) as my elective module is because I was interested in learning about prototyping skills. I was also interested in learning how to do 3D printing and laser cutting, thinking I would be able to learn some fundamentals on using such techniques. With some knowledge of HTML and CSS from one of my earlier modules, I want to learn how to apply them in designing a website.</p>
