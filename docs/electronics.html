				<p>
					This week as we were introduced to Arduino Uno and its software, we were provided to do certain tasks to familiarise ourselves with the software and the application of it. 
				</p>

				
				<h3>Task 1: Write a program to blink the LED in a variety of patterns.</h3>
				
				<p>
					The equipment that I used were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>USB Cable</li>
					<li>Breadboard</li>
					<li>Arduino Uno</li>
					<li>1 LED (I used red)</li>
					<li>3 jumper wires</li>
					<li>1 220ohm resistor (red, red, brown stripes)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Setup Process</h3>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Connect your components like the picture shown below:</li>
						<img src="../images/LEDcontrolcircuit.png" width="400px" height="auto">
						<li>Connect your USB port to your device (laptop, computer, etc)</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Coding Process</h3>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Using the Arduino software, click on the open icon and upload the blink code under “01.Basics”</li>
						<img src="../images/ledcode1.png" width="400px" height="auto">
						<li>From the code, setup the pins that you are using, I used pin 8 so my pin values are 8 here:</li>
						<img src="../images/ledcode2.png" width="400px" height="auto">
						<li>After that, input the time value you want for the LED to on and off. In the software, we use milliseconds. One second is equals to 1000 milliseconds. 
						</li>
						<li>Here, the LED should turn on for one second and off for one second.</li>
						<li>Play around with the time values. For the second timing, I made the intervals shorter as shown here below:</li>

					</ol>
				</p>


				<h3>Task 2: Controlling 2 LEDs using a switch</h3>
				<p>
					Continuing on from task 1, add on these components:
					<ul>
						<li>3 jumper wires</li>	
						<li>1 220ohm resistor</li>	
						<li>1 1kiloohm resistor (orange, black, brown stripes)</li>	
						<li>Different coloured LED (I used green) </li>
						<li>Pushbutton Switch</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Connect in the same arrangement as the previous one just using a different pin. For me, I used pin 7.</li>
				
						<li>Connect the rest of your components to the picture shown below:</li>
					</ol>

					<ul>
						<li>I used pin 6 for the pushbutton switch</li>
						<li>Connect your last jumper wire from the same column as your pushbutton switch to ground in your breadboard</li>
					</ul>

					Your arrangement should look something like this:

				</p>

				<h3>Coding Process</h3>
				<p>
					<img src="../images/switchcode2.png" width="400px" height="auto">
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>You need to setup your constant functions as in those that will not change. This will help you to code easier by using those function names.</li>
						<li>In this case, the button will be the one reading thus it should be INPUT whereas for the LEDs, there would be the outputs.</li>
						<li>“state = 0” means that we are assigning a value of 0 to the function “state”
						</li>
					
					<p>

					</p>

					<p>
						<img src="../images/switchcode4.png" width="400px" height="auto">
					</p>

						<li>I am using state to show what I want to happen in different cases.</li>
						</ol>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Case 0: LEDred is off, LEDgreen is off as well</li>
							<li>(Press)</li>
							<li>Case 1: LEDred is on, LEDgreen is off</li>
							<li>(Press)</li>
							<li>Case 2: LEDred is off, LEDgreen is on</li>
							<li>(Press)</li>
							<li>Case 3: LEDred and LEDgreen is on</li>
							<li>(Press-> goes back to Case 0)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

				<h3>Task 3: Flashing LEDs using switch</h3>
					<p>

						Demonstration
					</p>

				<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<p>I had a hard time trying to figure out the code on my own for the switch control part of the assignment. However, after asking for my teacher’s help, I learnt a lot of new things like how to use the state function to execute a sequence of cases. One challenge I also faced was that every time I pressed the button, it would jump and execute the next case even though it had not executed the previous one. This is called bouncing: It is when two metal parts come into contact to short the supply.
					This thus creates a false triggering or multiple triggering like the button is pressed multiple times.</p>
