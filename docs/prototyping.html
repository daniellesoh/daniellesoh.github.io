				<h3> Prototyping </h3>
					<p>For this week's assignment, we were tasked to develop a simple prototype using cardboard, in this case, I chose to do up a phone holder.</p>
				<h3>Research</h3>
					<img src="../images/woodenphone holder.jpg" alt="wooden phone holder" width="50%" height="auto">
					<p>This was made when I was sec 1 for one of my D&T projects. With this along with reference to <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Wooden-Phone-Stand/"> what I found online,</a> I tried to make it foldable. 
				<h3>Process</h3>

    					</td>
    					<td>
							<li>I sketched out the dimensions in 3D roughly on paper and outlined it with a black marker for better visibility. My intention was to make a whole piece with folds so that it could become a box.</li>
							<li>I drew out all the parts onto the cardboard in one long continuous strip as shown in the picture below: </li>
							<li>I use stripes to indicate which areas I need to cut out and remove.</li>
							<li>After cutting them out using a penknife, scissors and a ruler, I scored lines where I needed the cardboard to fold as well as for the flaps.</li>
							<li>Fold into a box and make a valley on the parts where your phone should rest on.</li>
